Welcome to my website! 

I am a **2nd year PhD student** at [CREST](https://www.crest.science)/[Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.polytechnique.edu) since October '23, under the supervision of [Pierre Boyer](www.pierrecboyer.com) (Polytechnique and CREST) and [Benoit Schmutz-Bloch](https://sites.google.com/site/benoitschmutz/home) (Polytechnique and CREST). I will visit Wharton (UPenn) from January to April 2026, sponsored by [Gilles Duranton](https://real-faculty.wharton.upenn.edu/duranton){:target="_blank"}.

During Spring 2025, I visited the Berlin Quantitative Spatial Economics Group ([bqse](https://bqse.de)), sponsored by [Gabriel Ahlfeldt](https://sites.google.com/view/ahlfeldt/home) (Humboldt Universität). 
I hold a **MPhil. in Advanced Economics** from [Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon](http://economie.ens-lyon.fr){:target="_blank"}'s Department of Economics and I am a **former research assistant** at [HEC Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/hec/fr/home.html){:target="_blank"}, to [Mathias Thoenig](https://people.unil.ch/mathiasthoenig/){:target="_blank"}.

My thesis investigates questions related to **spatial economics**. A large part of my research agenda investigates how **population ageing** shapes cities and inter-regional inequalities, in addition of **climate change**. I am also interested in the **post-industrialization** history of cities, from plant closure spatial effects to urban brownfields renewal. I mainly apply **structural** and **reduced** form tools to highly spatially disaggregated data. 

I also coordinate a PhD-level seminar series in urban and spatial economics for students in the Parisian area. Don't hesitate to reach out if you want to be in the mailing list! It starts in April 2024. [Find all information here!](https://mateomoglia.github.io/seminars/)
