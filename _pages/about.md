Welcome to my website! 

I am a **1st year PhD student** at [CREST](https://www.crest.science)/[Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.polytechnique.edu) since October '23, under the supervision of [Pierre Boyer](www.pierrecboyer.com) (Polytechnique and CREST) and [Benoit Schmutz](https://sites.google.com/site/benoitschmutz/home) (Polytechnique and CREST). 

I hold a **MPhil. in Advanced Economics** from [Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon](http://economie.ens-lyon.fr){:target="_blank"}'s Department of Economics and I am a **former research assistant** at [HEC Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/hec/fr/home.html){:target="_blank"}, to[Mathias Thoenig](https://people.unil.ch/mathiasthoenig/){:target="_blank"}.

My thesis will investigate questions related to spatial economics, especially residential migrations, and political economy, with a focus on local electoral behaviors. 

I also coordinate a PhD-level seminar series in urban and spatial economics for students in the Parisian area. Don't hesitate to reach out if you want to be in the mailing list! It starts in April 2024.

<!--- I defended my **master's thesis** (available upon request) in September 2022. It assesses the effects of negative TFP shock on French local labor markets, especially through the spatial reallocations of workers. The structural approach allowed me to compute the general effects of a nationwide negative shock on the manufacturing sector and the local implications in terms of wages, labor force composition and workers welfare. --->

<!--- I also hold a Bachelor in Economics from ENS de Lyon, a school I entered in after 2 years of *Classes Préparatoires aux Grandes Écoles* ENS D2, an intensive program in mathematics and economics that prepares to highly competitive entry exams of French "Grandes écoles" (top undergrad schools). --->

#At the moment
#======

#During my predoc, **I am assisting Pr. Thoenig** and his coauthors: [Fabrizio Colella](https://www.fabriziocolella.com){:target="_blank"}, [Pr. Mathieu Couttenier](https://sites.google.com/site/coutteniermathieu/home){:target="_blank"}, [Seyhun Sakalli](https://sites.google.com/site/sosakalli/){:target="_blank"}, especially. I **collected quantitative and qualitative data** on conflicts, African ethnic groups and crops prices. Moreover, I helped implementing and improving the [*acreg*](https://acregstata.weebly.com) function on Stata. At the moment, I am building a network of all roads in Africa in order to compute shortest path and quickest path algorithms between two given points (*see the code in Code*).

#I also teach a quantitative methods class for master's students at ENS de Lyon, as well as being an oral examiner in *classes préparatoires*

#Finally, I also co-organized the **10th EcoNomicSDays @ ENS de Lyon**. On December 13th and 14th, seven top-class researchers presented their last researches on gender economics. The program is available [here](http://economie.ens-lyon.fr/en/news/10th-economics-day-december-13-14){:target="_blank"}.

#What's next?
#======
#For 2023 onwards, I will be a **PhD candidate**. I am currently applying to several European programs. 

#My fields of expertise are **urban and spatial economics**. For my thesis, I would like to investigate the connexions that may exist between economic agents location choices, local (labor) markets, (local) taxations and (local) politics, with a preference for a structural approach.
