Welcome to my website. 

Holding a MPhil. in Advanced Economics from [Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon](www.economie.ens-lyon.fr)'s Department of Economics, I am currently research assistant [HEC Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/hec/fr/home.html), a component of University of Lausanne, under the supervision of [Pr. Mathias Thoenig](https://people.unil.ch/mathiasthoenig/).

I also hold a Bachelor in Economics from ENS de Lyon, a school I entered after 2 years of *Classes Préparatoires aux Grandes Écoles* ENS D2, an intensive program in mathematics and economics that prepares to highly competitive entry exams of French "Grandes écoles" (top undergrad schools).

At the moment
======
I defended my master's thesis (available upon request) in September 2022. It assesses the effects of negative TFP shock on French local labor markets, especially through the spatial reallocations of workers. The structural approach allowed me to compute the general effects of a nationwide negative shock on the manufacturing sector and the local implications in terms of wages, labor force composition and workers welfare.

During my predoc, I assist Pr. Thoenig and his coauthors: [Fabrizio Colella](https://www.fabriziocolella.com), [Pr. Mathieu Couttenier](https://sites.google.com/site/coutteniermathieu/home), [Seyhun Sakalli](https://sites.google.com/site/sosakalli/), especially. I collected quantitative and qualitative data on conflicts, African ethnic groups and crops prices. But my main mission is to implement and improve the [*acreg*](https://acregstata.weebly.com) function on Stata.

Finally, I also co-organized the 10th EcoNomicSDays @ ENS de Lyon. On December 13th and 14th, seven top-class researchers presented their last researches on gender economics. The program is available [here](http://economie.ens-lyon.fr/en/news/10th-economics-day-december-13-14).

What's next?
======
For 2023 onwards, I will be a PhD candidate. I am still applying to several European programs. 

My fields of expertise are urban and spatial economics. For my thesis, I would like to investigate the connexions that may exist between economic agents location choices, local (labor) markets, (local) taxations and (local) politics, with a preference for a structural approach.
