I much enjoy coding and discovering new ways to do it. Throughout my research career I worked on several projects that required to produce original code I feel confident to share on my [github](https://github.com/mateomoglia). Here, I highlight some output:

### [Afriroads](https://github.com/mateomoglia/afriroads)
 
From a shapefile to a shortest path algorithm + original delineation of cities in Africa. Coded in R. 


### [Topics in Economics course](https://mateomoglia.github.io/2025_eco1s002/home.html)


Create an original .html website for teaching purpose (Topics in Economics Bachelor class). It contains an introduction to R and some replication exercises.

### [Norway routes](https://github.com/mateomoglia/osrm_norway)

Use a leaflet to visualize road itinaries between Norway main cities thanks to OSRM.
