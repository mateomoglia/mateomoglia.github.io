Throughout my research agenda, I enjoy coding, especially in R and Stata, original output. Here, I summarize the code that I was able to produce in diverse projects:

<ol>
  <li>African roads project: to input shapefiles to shortest paths algorithms to join cities in Africa </li>
  <li>Topics in Economics and Introduction to R class</li>
  <li>Visualize road itinaries in Norway</li>
</ol>
